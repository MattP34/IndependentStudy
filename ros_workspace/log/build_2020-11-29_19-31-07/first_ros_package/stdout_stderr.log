CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpointcloud_to_laserscan.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "pointcloud_to_laserscan", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "pointcloud_to_laserscan" with any of the following names:

    pointcloud_to_laserscanConfig.cmake
    pointcloud_to_laserscan-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pointcloud_to_laserscan" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "pointcloud_to_laserscan_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "pointcloud_to_laserscan" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
